Docker Images for CI/CD

## Making Packages Public

To make the Docker images public, you need to change the package visibility settings on GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/getfanq/packages/container/ci/settings
2. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change package visibility"
4. Select "Public" and confirm

This needs to be done only once. Once the package is public, all future pushes will maintain the public visibility.
